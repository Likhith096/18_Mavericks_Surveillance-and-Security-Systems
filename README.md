# 18_Mavericks_Surveillance-and-Security-Systems

## Overview
The AI-Powered Home Security System is designed to provide an innovative and practical solution for home safety by leveraging AI to detect, classify, and respond to suspicious sounds in real-time. This system adapts to user feedback, offers intuitive monitoring tools, and includes advanced features for enhanced security.

## Features
1. **Sound Detection**  
   - Detects suspicious sounds such as glass breaking, screams, or other unusual noises.

2. **Threat Classification**  
   - Classifies detected sounds into threat levels: low, medium, or high.

3. **Real-Time Alerts**  
   - Triggers real-time visual and audio alerts directly on a laptop.  
   - Sends external notifications when necessary.

4. **Panic Mode**  
   - Activates an emergency alert system for immediate response.


5. **Adaptive Learning**  
   - Continuously improves detection accuracy by learning from user feedback and historical data.

6. **User Interface (UI)**  
   - Offers a simple and intuitive interface for monitoring and managing alerts.




## Getting Started
1. **Setup and Installation**  
   - Install the application on your laptop or compatible device.  
   - Configure the sound sensors and connect any additional devices.

2. **Configuration**  
   - Customize detection settings based on your environment.  
   - Enable Panic Mode and GPS integration if required.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**  
   - Use the UI to monitor the system and manage real-time alerts.  
   - Provide feedback to improve the systemâ€™s learning capabilities.

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced sound classification using deep learning.  
- Integration with smart home devices (e.g., cameras, door locks).  
- Multi-device synchronization for broader coverage.
- Time-Based Noise Differentiation
- Adaptive learning
